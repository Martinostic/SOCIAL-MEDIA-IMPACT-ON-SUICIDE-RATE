# SOCIAL-MEDIA-IMPACT-ON-SUICIDE-RATE
This project explores the correlation between rising social media usage (Twitter and Facebook) and changes in suicide rates over time. By analyzing trends across genders and platforms, the study highlights how digital behavior patterns intersect with societal challenges.
Project Title

ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACT ON SUICIDE RATES

Project Summary

This project investigates the potential correlation between the rise of social media usage (Twitter and Facebook) and changes in suicide rates over time. By analyzing trends across genders and platforms, the study highlights key insights into how digital behavior patterns may intersect with societal challenges.

Key Skills

Data Analytics: Proficient in analyzing and interpreting complex datasets to uncover meaningful trends.
Business Intelligence: Skilled in creating interactive dashboards for actionable insights using tools like Power BI.
Trend Analysis: Expertise in identifying patterns and deviations to support evidence-based decision-making.
Data Visualization: Ability to design visually compelling charts that communicate key findings effectively.

Methodology

Data Collection:
Data was gathered from historical records of suicide rates and user growth trends on major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
Data Visualization:
Visualized through Power BI to provide a comparative analysis of gender-specific trends, social media growth, and corresponding changes in suicide rates.
Trend Analysis:
Patterns were studied across years, emphasizing growth in social media users and its proportional impact on societal challenges.
Performance Benchmarking:
Metrics were benchmarked by comparing suicide rate changes against gender and platform-specific user growth since 2010.

Observations

Social Media Growth:
Twitter experienced a significant user percentage growth (13.88K) since 2010, surpassing Facebook’s growth (7.66K).
Male, Female, and other gender categories showed consistent increases in Facebook and Twitter users.
Suicide Rate Trends:
The overall suicide rate percentage change since 2010 was 2.82K, with males (MLE) and females (FMLE) showing slightly different patterns.
Average suicide rate changes by gender revealed that males had the highest rates (946%), followed by Others (943) and Females (926).
Gender-Specific Insights:

·        The impact of social media usage on suicide rates appears comparable across genders, with males, females, and other genders showing proportional trends between usage and rate changes.

·        Facebook user growth correlates more closely with higher suicide rate changes compared to Twitter.

Platform Comparison:
Twitter outpaces Facebook in terms of user growth since 2010; however, Facebook shows a stronger correlation with changes in suicide rates.

Recommendations

Targeted Awareness Campaigns:
Develop gender-specific mental health awareness programs addressing potential risks associated with increased social media usage.
Collaborative Efforts:
Social media companies, health organizations, and governments should work together to introduce tools or interventions that monitor and mitigate harmful online behavior.
Further Research:
Expand the scope of the study to include other platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) and factors like regional disparities and socio-economic conditions.
Responsible Social Media Policies:
Encourage platforms to implement user safeguards, such as promoting positive content, restricting harmful interactions, and providing access to crisis resources.
Education and Training:
Equip educators and parents with resources to understand the impact of social media, enabling them to guide young users effectively.Project Title
